# Starter Javascript Template

## Overview

This setup allows you to get started with writing your Javascript project.

Any images you want to use in your project should be in your images folder.

Be sure that if you create `env.js` that you add it to the .gitignore and commit the gitignore.

To run your project run

`npm install`

then

`node server.js`
